# BRobot Walkthrough

This section will introduce you to the basics of using BRobot to control mechanical actuators, and walk you through different examples that cover most of the aspects that make this library easy, powerful and fun to work with. 


## Disclaimer

__Working with robots is dangerous.__ Robotic actuators are very powerful machines, but for the most part extremely unaware of their environment; if it collides with something, including yourself, it will not detect it and try to keep going, posing a threat to itself and the operators surrounding it. This is particularly relevant when running in 'automatic' mode, where several security measures are bypassed for the sake of performance.

When using robots in a real-time interactive environment, plase make sure:
- You have been __adequately trained__ to use that particular machine,
- you are in __good physical and mental condition__,
- you are operating the robot under the __utmost security measures__,
- you are following the facility's and facility staff's __security protocols__,
- and the robot has the __appropriate guarding__ in place, including, but not reduced to, e-stops, physical barriers, light courtains, etc. 

__BRobot is in a very early stage of development.__ You are using this software at your own risk, no warranties are provided herewith, and unexpected results/bugs may arise during its use. Always test and simulate your applications thoroughly before running them in a real device. The author/s shall not be liable for any injuries, damages or losses consequence of using this software in any way.


## Introduction

BRobot is a .NET library for real-time manipulation and control of mechanical actuators. It exposes a human-relatable high-level API of abstract actions, which are managed and streamed to connected devices in real time. BRobot is particularly suited for building interactive applications that make the most of sensing and acting on the environment through physical devices.

As of version 0.1.0, BRobot can only interface with ABB robotic arms, and this will be the main focus of the examples provided in this walkthrough. More devices will hopefully come soon, such as Kuka robots, Universal Robots, Arduinos, 3D printers, drones, etc... If you are interested in helping with this, please check the Contribute section.
